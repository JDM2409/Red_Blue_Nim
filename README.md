# Red_Blue_Nim
An Implementation of the Red_Blue_Nim game using AI . This version however can pick either only one or two blue/red marbles at a turn .
In this version , there are two players , the human and the computer. 
The player that picks the last ball making either pile zero is the winner in the standard version of the game and the player who picks the last ball making either pile zero is the loser in the misere version.
When either pile is zero , in standard version a score is also calculated for the winner, which is the number of remaining balls * (2 for red) and (*3 for blue) . In Misere version a score is also calculated but for the loser , which is the number of remaining balls * (2 for red) and (*3 for blue) .
The operation of the program and the commands guidleines are in the othere readme in the repository.
